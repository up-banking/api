                "description": "Once you have created a webhook in the Up API, events are sent to the\nwebhook’s configured URL as JSON-encoded `POST` requests. The webhook\nURL must respond with a HTTP `200` status on success.\n\nIt is important that the URL responds in a timely manner. If the URL\ntakes too long to respond (currently 30s), the request will be timed\nout. For this reason it is strongly advised to avoid any heavy\nprocessing before a response has been returned from the URL. A common\nsolution to this problem is to use a message broker such as RabbitMQ\nto do the work asynchronously.\n\nEvent delivery is retried with exponential backoff in the case of any\nnon `200` response status, if the URL is unreachable, or if the request\nis timed out.\n\nRefer to the `eventType` attribute in order to determine what course of\naction to take when handling the event. The following event types are\ncurrently sent:\n\n**`PING`**\n\nManually triggered by calls to the webhook `ping` endpoint. Used for\ntesting and debugging purposes.\n\n**`TRANSACTION_CREATED`**\n\nTriggered whenever a new transaction is created in Up. This event\nincludes a `transaction` relationship that provides the unique\nidentifier for the transaction and a link to the transaction within the\nUp API. This link should be used to retrieve the complete transaction\ndata.\n\n**`TRANSACTION_SETTLED`**\n\nTriggered whenever a transaction transitions from the `HELD` status to\nthe `SETTLED` status. This event includes a `transaction` relationship\nthat provides the unique identifier for the transaction and a link to\nthe transaction within the Up API. This link should be used to retrieve\nthe complete transaction data.\n\nDue to external factors in banking processes, on rare occasions this\nevent may not be triggered. Separate `TRANSACTION_DELETED` and\n`TRANSACTION_CREATED` events will be received in its place.\n\n**`TRANSACTION_DELETED`**\n\nTriggered whenever a `HELD` transaction is deleted from Up. This\ngenerally occurs for example when a hotel deposit is returned. This\nevent includes a `transaction` relationship that provides the unique\nidentifier for the transaction, however no link is provided to the\ntransaction within the Up API as it no longer exists.\n",
